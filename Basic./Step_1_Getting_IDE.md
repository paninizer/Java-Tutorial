So, I guess you are here for the tutorial. And that you never used java in your life before. I'll explain the basics here and perhaps answer any questions you have.


**Q&A**

What is Java:
Java is a high level programming language that's class based and object oriented. Maybe it's the most object oriented language ever (EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT!!!)

Difference from JavaScript (JS):
Java is a compile language (it must be compiled). JavaScript, on the other hand, is a scripting language that only needs to be interpreted.
Java is mostly used for softwares and back-end developing. JavaScript is used more for web developing.

Java or Python?
Python is arguably one of the best beginner programming languages out there, as it offers easy-to-understand functions and commands. It can be used for small to medium-sized
projects.
Java is also a good beginner programming language, but is definitely harder. But the versatility of project sizes compared to Python makes it a good language to learn.
Java can also make Android programs and softwares, in case you didn't know.

Getting a Java IDE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many IDEs out there for Java, and many great ones too. I would recommend Eclipse for beginners, though, as its readability is far better than VS Code (if you use it for 
Python) and it has many shortcuts to make your life easier. Go to https://www.eclipse.org/downloads to download the file. Run it and follow all instructions on screen. One thing 
though, don't install it in your C:// drive. If C:// gets clogged up, you might get performance declines and some nightmares you don't want. Also, I suggest at least have 8 GB of 
RAM on your computer for Eclipse. You also will need to download and install Java JDK, which can be found here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-linux.
Navigate to the OS you need. Note: Mac OS X has Java preinstalled so you only need to install Eclipse. After you installed it, navigate to step 2.
